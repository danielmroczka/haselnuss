Java Key Value Database

Simple implementation of key-value database. Base algorithm used is a HashMap.
Designed working modes are:
- in memory embedded database 
- file storage embedded database
- file storage embedded database with zipped database file
- rest server
- tcp server

This project is a rather somekind of sandbox and database implementation is not very important at first step that's why i use pure hash map.
